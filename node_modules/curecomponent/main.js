console.log('Hello from main.');
//example component is the Site component
//need to render a Static view
//for Admin
//so AdminStatic is name of view

//maybe a different class (object?) for each view of Site data
//define types of fields and properties that a site has

//these can all be Fields as part of Records so that they can be edited
//as such

//

//so each component has method like

//init(data)
//render(context)
//properties (each has Type)
//probably includes children
// (propertyChanged event?)
//


//server.js and client.js

//Site component:

//init(data) {

//}

//render(context)


//plugin to app.js
//get object named 'root'
//from datastore (use cached if available)
//lookup type (use cached if available)
//instantiate type

//call render on it
//mode = design
//data = root
