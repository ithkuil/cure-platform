render some text on the page

Pipe/data flow style one method on each verb object: run




Site object

   Pages class

     Page object
      
        Nav object --> mostly the same except for the current page
                       being indicated

        Content object --> display different things
                           depending on context

   Page object
      
      Rendered according to PageTemplate object
      
    
              
For templating use coffeekup

but I want templates to be very small and simple

Use repeat or looper object instead of loops

I want a widget that I can drag around
Then I want to be able to put them inside
And edit their properties

Then they generate code
So I am editing the template graphically

head = new Slot 'head'

body = new Slot 'body', [ 'top', 'main', 'end' ]
  
html = new Slot 'html', [ head, body ]
html:
  slots: [ head, body ]    

html = new Slot
  html: [
    head
    body: [
      top
      main
      end
    ]
  ]
